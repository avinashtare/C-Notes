# Control Structure

* In programming we need to sometime control the flow of operation other then just the sequential statements.In this case we need to use control statements.

* Control statements are classified into two types of statements:
	1. Conditional Statements
	2. Iterative Statements

### Conditional Statements

* Conditional Statements are use to perform the operation based on a particular condition.
* `if` a condition is true perform one task else perform another task.
* Conditional statements also called as `selective statements`
* These statements select a particular statement to be executed based on the condition.
* In c++ we have two conditional statments namely:
	* if-else
	* switch case

### Iterative Statements

* Iterative statements are use to perform a particular task (operation) `repetitively` for certain number of times.
*  Iterative Statements also called as `repetitive statements`.
* In c++ we have three types of iterative statements:
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do while loop
