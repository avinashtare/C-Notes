### Iterative Statements

* Iterative statements are use to perform a particular task (operation) `repetitively` for certain number of times.
*  Iterative Statements also called as `repetitive statements`.
* In c++ we have three types of iterative statements:
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do while loop

* In C++ loop are classified in to tow parts `Entry Control loop` & `Exit Control Loop`.

## Entry Control loop
* In the entry control loop number of iteration is known.
* In an entry controlled loop, the test condition is checked before entering the loop body.

**Types Of Entry Control Loop**
  
- [for-loop](./for-loop.md)
- [while-loop](./while-loop.md)

## Exit Control Loop
* In the exit control loop number of iteration is unknown.
*  In an exit controlled loop, the test condition is checked at the end of the loop body.

**Types Of Exit Control Loop**
  
  - [do-while-loop](./do-while-loop.md)
