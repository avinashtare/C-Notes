# Exercise 14

## Questions
**Array:**
1.Declare an integer array named 'numbers' with a size of 5 and initialize it with values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Print the elements of the array.
2.Given two sorted arrays, 'arr1' and 'arr2', merge them into a new array named 'mergedArr' while maintaining the sorted order. Assume 'mergedArr' has enough space to accommodate all elements.
2.Write a program in C++ to find and print the largest element in an array.
4.Implement an algorithm in C++ to rotate an array to the right by a given number of positions. For example, if the array is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the rotation is 2, the array should become {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}.
5.Implement a function in C++ to find the subarray with the largest sum (contiguous elements) in an array of integers. The function should return the starting and ending indices of the subarray and its sum.
