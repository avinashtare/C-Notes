# Typecasting in C++

Typecasting in C++ involves converting a value from one data type to another. There are two main types of typecasting: implicit and explicit.

## Implicit Typecasting (Automatic Type Conversion)

- This happens automatically by the compiler.
- It is also known as widening or promotion.
- It occurs when a smaller data type is converted to a larger data type.
- There is no loss of data in implicit typecasting.

```cpp
int integerNumber = 10;
double doubleNumber = integerNumber; // Implicit typecasting from int to double
```

# Explicit Typecasting (Manual Type Conversion)

- This requires the programmer to specify the type to which the value should be converted.
- It is also known as narrowing or demotion.
- There may be a loss of data in explicit typecasting.

```c++
double doubleNumber = 10.5;
int integerNumber = static_cast<int>(doubleNumber); // Explicit typecasting from double to int
```
C++ provides several ways to perform explicit typecasting:

* C-style casting:
```cpp
int integerNumber = (int)doubleNumber; // C-style casting
```

* Functional casting:

```cpp
int integerNumber = int(doubleNumber); // Functional casting
```

* Static_cast:
```cpp
int integerNumber = static_cast<int>(doubleNumber); // static_cast
```

* Dynamic_cast (used for polymorphic classes):

```cpp
int integerNumber = reinterpret_cast<int>(&somePointer); // reinterpret_cast
```

* Const_cast (used to add or remove const qualifier):

```cpp
const int constNumber = 5;
int* nonConstPointer = const_cast<int*>(&constNumber); // const_cast
```

When performing typecasting, it's important to be cautious to avoid potential data loss and unexpected behavior, especially with explicit typecasting. Always ensure that the conversion makes sense in the context of your program.
