# What is C++ ?

- C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

- C++ was developed by `Bjarne Stroustrup`, as an extension to the C language in `1985`.

- C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

- The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

## Why Use C++

- C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

- C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

- C++ is an object-oriented programming language that gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

- C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
-  C++ is fun and easy to learn!

- As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

## Installation For Windows

- Download Mingw from here https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download
- double click then install software 
- Install CPP base and other requirements
### Set Environment Variables
 - After installation, add Mingw to your system's PATH environment variable:

- Open the System Properties window:
- On Windows 10, right-click on the Start button, and select "System."
- Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left.
- Click the "Environment Variables" button.
- add environment variable path in the path list
- Path will look like:- c:\mingw\bin

## how to run files
- Before running first verify installation MINGW install or not run this command

```shell
cmd> c++ --version
```
### simple program
- Create Your First Program File with <filename>.cpp extension
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout<<"Hello Word";
    return 0;
}
```
- Run your input cpp file
```shell
cmd> c++ <filename>.cpp
```
- It produces a a.exe file on your current working directory
- Run this file for output
```cpp
a.exe
```
* Output Will Be
`` Hello World ``
